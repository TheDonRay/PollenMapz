# 🌿 PollenMapz

**Your personal tool to help you enjoy the beauty of nature while avoiding its allergies.**

## About This Project

PollenMapz is a backend development project that helps people check pollen levels at specific locations before heading out. Instead of relying on vague pollen forecasts, you'll be able to see detailed pollen information for any address you enter, displayed in an interactive 3D view.

## Why I Built This

This project started from two places: curiosity and personal need.

I've always wondered how websites work behind the scenes. What happens when you click a button? How does the server handle your request? This curiosity led me down the path of backend development, and PollenMapz became my way to really dive in and learn.

But there's also a personal side to this. Like many people, I deal with allergies—the sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and all the frustration that comes with it. It's tough when you just want to enjoy time outside with family and friends but end up unprepared for high pollen days.

That's where PollenMapz comes in: a tool that gives you specific, location-based pollen information so you can plan ahead and stay comfortable.

## What It Does

- Check pollen levels for specific addresses
- View pollen data in an interactive 3D map
- Get detailed information instead of general forecasts
- Plan your outdoor activities with confidence

## Technologies

This is primarily a backend project where I'm learning about:
- Server-side & Client Side programming 
- API development
- Database management
- Request handling
- Data visualization

*Built with curiosity, driven by necessity, and powered by the desire to make outdoor life more enjoyable for everyone with allergies.*
