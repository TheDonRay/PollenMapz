ðŸŒ¿ PollenMapz - Your Personal tool to help you enjoy the beauty of nature but also avoid its allergies. 

PollenMapz is a backend project that offers me the opportunity to truly immerse myself in the world of backend development. I've always been curious about how websites handle requests and what happens behind the scenes when I interact with a site. That curiosity sparked my interest in exploring backend development more deeply, ultimately leading me toward a passion for backend engineering. 

However, it wasnâ€™t just curiosity that drove this projectâ€”it was also a personal connection. Like many of you who struggle with allergies, I know how frustrating it can be to deal with constant itching, sneezing, coughing, or watery eyes, especially when you're just trying to enjoy time with family and friends. Itâ€™s something no one wants to go through unprepared.

Instead of relying on vague pollen forecasts, why not use a platform that shows detailed pollen levels across different locations based on the specific address you provide? And I just don't mean words, but a 3D view of the location you are trying to go to and how bad the pollen is at that location!  Thatâ€™s the goal of PollenMapzâ€”to help users stay informed and ready wherever they go. 

Stay Tuned as I progress and apply what I learn to this project !
